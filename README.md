My dotfiles spread across MacOS for my JavaScript development setup.

> IMPORTANT: don't copy and paste take a look at what would work best for you. I suggest starting with downloading VS Code extensions.

### Installation

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in ~/Projects/dotfiles)

```git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles```

### macOS defaults
When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults. I use the ```.macos``` file for these commands.

### Homebrew
When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course). I use the ```.brewfile``` to install some necessary programs to my machine, take a look for yourself if you have them go ahead and ignore this file.

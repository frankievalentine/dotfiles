## Introduction

This repository is a resource to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything needed to install my preferred setup of macOS is detailed here.

## Setup

These instructions are for setting up new Mac devices. Instead, if you want to get started building your own dotfiles, you can [find those instructions below](#your-own-dotfiles).

### Create a separate volume to test install (optional)

After you've set up your new Mac you may want to wipe and clean install your old Mac. Follow [Installing macOS on a separate APFS volume - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208891) to do that. Don't forget to backup before messing with Disk Utility.

### Backup your data

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install Mackup and backup your settings with the commands below. Your settings will be synced to iCloud so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different directory or different storage than iCloud, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#storage). Also make sure your `.zshrc` file is symlinked from your dotfiles repo to your home directory.

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```

If you're migrating from an existing Mac, you should first make sure to backup all of your existing data. Go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you migrate.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?
- Did you update [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to the latest version and ran `mackup backup`?

## What's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you.
[Fork it](https://github.com/frankievalentine/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't
use, and build on what you do use.

## Components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frankievalentine/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.

### Step by step

After backing up your old Mac you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new one.

1. Update macOS to the latest version through system preferences
2. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankievalentine/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

   ```zsh
   git clone --recursive git@github.com:frankievalentine/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

4. Run the installation with:

   ```zsh
   cd ~/.dotfiles && ./dots.sh
   ```

5. After mackup is synced with your cloud storage, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
6. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> 💡 You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.

## Make it your own!

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`path.zsh`](./path.zsh) file. These files get loaded in because the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` setting points to the `.dotfiles` directory. You can adjust the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file to your liking.

## Bugs

I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should
work for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That
said, I do use this as _my_ dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break
something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.

If you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/frankievalentine/dotfiles/issues) on this repository
and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

**Enjoy!**

<!-- ## Thanks To...

I first got the idea for starting this project by visiting the [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) project. Both [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) were great sources of inspiration. [Sourabh Bajaj](https://twitter.com/sb2nov/)'s [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/) proved to be invaluable. Thanks to [@subnixr](https://github.com/subnixr) for [his awesome Zsh theme](https://github.com/subnixr/minimal)! Thanks to [Caneco](https://twitter.com/caneco) for the header in this readme. And lastly, I'd like to thank [Emma Fabre](https://twitter.com/anahkiasen) for [her excellent presentation on Homebrew](https://speakerdeck.com/anahkiasen/a-storm-homebrewin) which made me migrate a lot to a [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) and [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup). -->
